      <h3>Trance</h3>
      <p class="text-primary">
        Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed during the 1990s in Germany.
        It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM),
         repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements
         throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 "peaks" or "drops."
      </p>
      <p class="text-primary">
        Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical
        styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house,
       ambient, and film music.

      <p class="text-primary">
        Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a
        broad range of percussive electronic music genres produced largely for nightclubs, raves, and
        festivals...
        </p>
      <p class="text-primary">
        Produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs), EDM is generally used in the context of a live mix,
         where a DJ creates a seamless selection of tracks by segueing from one recording to the next..

    <abbr title="A disc jockey">
    A Disk Jockey</abbr> (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing.
     Originally, the "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to gramophone records,
    but now "DJ" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any
    sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for
    a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution.
DJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and mix them together.
This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs.
 Often, this involves aligning the beats of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are
 played together. </p>
    <p class="text-primary">

        <mark>
            <blockquote>DJ equipment also allows the DJ to preview a source of recorded music in headphones
   before playing it for the audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track
   they want to play and cue up the track to the desired starting location so it will mix well with the
    currently playing music...
